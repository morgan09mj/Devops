# Create and Configure Jobs and Pipelines Using YAML
## Description
YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization language that is commonly used for configuration files. To find more about YAML, see https://yaml.org/.

In DevCS, you can use a YAML file (a file with .yml extension) to store a job or a pipeline configuration in any of the project's Git repositories. The build system constantly monitors the Git repositories and, when it detects a YAML file, creates or updates a job or a pipeline with the specified configuration.
